Subject: Tomcat vs. Resin


> I ran an informal test for 9 hours last night on a Win98 PC comparing the
> latest tomcat(apache.org) code and the latest resin
> (caucho.com) both using Suns JDK 1.2.  I used 2 instances of socrates to
> simulate 100 users requesting a hello.jsp file at random intervals.
> Tomcat and Resin were running at the same time on different ports.

> Result: Tomcat: Resin:
> Total Requests Handled 26094 6546375
> Total Requests Dropped 4691 0
> Requests per Second .1 195
> Average Latency 98.17 .15
>
> I'm assuming the dramatic difference in requests handled is due to a 60
> second timeout on dropped requests.

> I'm wondering if anyone can explain the dramatic difference in the
results?
